Description: This package delivers a complete, reproducible workflow for QSAR 
    model development using SEND data. It automates data retrieval and preprocessing, 
    computes organ‑specific toxicity scores, derives molecular descriptors, and
    provides built‑in tools for rigorous model evaluation—so you can focus on
    uncovering predictive insights rather than writing boilerplate code.
