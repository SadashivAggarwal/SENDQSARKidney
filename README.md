About
•	This package delivers a complete, reproducible workflow for QSAR model development using SEND data. It automates data retrieval and preprocessing, computes organ‑specific toxicity scores, derives molecular descriptors, and provides built‑in tools for rigorous model evaluation—so you can focus on uncovering predictive insights rather than writing boilerplate code. 
•	Detailed usage examples and API documentation for every function can be found in the “Articles” section of our GitHub site (add link here).
